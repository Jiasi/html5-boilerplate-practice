	      Batman Begins is a well told story of the origin of Bruce Wayne/Batman (Christian Bale). It
	      covers a lot of the same ground as Michael Keaton's original Batman, but goes much further in
	      depth in many factors of his creation. It goes into great detail about subjects such as how he
	      got his costume, what exactly it is. Same goes with the Batmobile. We also find out why he
	      chose to be bat-like.
	      </p>
	      <p>
	      One of the more interesting aspects here is how it shows Bruce's father, Thomas Wayne
	      (Linus Roache), and how he molded Bruce's life and instilled good judgment within him, a point
	      which is misunderstood about him by most people he comes in contact with. Thomas, too, teaches
	      Bruce valuable lesson, such as "We fall so we can learn to pick ourselves up". This is pretty
	      close to the theme of the movie or motto Bruce Wayne lives by. The resemblance of the father &
	      son is pretty good, too.
	      </p>
	      <p>
	      I also thoroughly enjoyed the training Bruce Wayne endured becoming "invincible". Bruce is
	      trained by Ducard (Liam Neeson) in many ways like a ninja (The concept of Batman IS similar to
	      a ninja). He is taught many valuable lessons in this temple and is shown no mercy. Eventually,
	      we even see his first real enemy as a superhero/vigilante.
	      </p>
	      <p>
	      Although I am not positive as to how true to the comic book this movie is, I am sure it took a
	      few liberties, as did Spider-Man. Most of the small examples I have noticed are for the better
	      and make for a good story. The Batmobile is more believable as an expensive armored vehicle
	      that the military would not spend the money on than a juiced up Corvette (or whatever that
	      was). Same with the Batsuit.
